# World-Population-Analysis-2023

### This project analyzes data on the current population for 2023, population growth rate, and world percentage of the top 10 most densely populated countries in the world. The dataset was collected from Kaggle and includes information such as the country name, current population, projected population for 2022, area, land area, density, growth rate, world percentage, and rank. Using Python and various data visualization libraries, we explore the data to determine which countries are the most densely populated and which countries have the highest population growth rates and world percentages. Through this analysis, we gain insights into the current state and trends of global population growth.
